I was wondering if there was a simple script that can grab and run the install command shown for missing programmes?


example:

On a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.10 I typed ``neofetch`` (which is a great little tool to show you info at a glance about your system)

However it's not installed by default so the terminal prints out:

```
Command 'neofetch' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo apt install neofetch
```

Much like the times when I enter a command and forget to add sudo at the start, I can type ``sudo !!`` and it will repeat the last command but put sudo in front of it.

I wonder if when you type in a programme name that isn't yet installed, is there a command to grab the suggested installation line and run it? (eg. ``sudo apt install neofetch``)

Let me know via Twitter @hobbsy if you have any suggestions :)
