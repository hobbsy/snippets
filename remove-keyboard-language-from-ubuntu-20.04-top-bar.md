# How to remove the keyboard language icon indicator in Ubuntu 20.04 top bar

If you have two language keyboard inputs set up by default on your new Ubuntu install, ie.

- English (UK)
- English (United States)

You may find there is a en1 and en2 icon on the right-hand side of the top bar, to allow you to switch between them.

I wanted to get rid of this but couldn't find the answer via Google/DuckDuckGo. An easy solution is just to delete one of them to leave a single keyboard language. This removed the en1/en2 icon for me.

You can get to the menu to delete a keyboard language via:

Settings > Language and Region > Input Sources
